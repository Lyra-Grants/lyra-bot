# Lyrabot Pre-Avalon _/

Pre Avalon Lyra Bot, integrated with twitter and telegram.

## Overview

Bot is .Net Core using the Nethereum + Tweetinvi libraries.

### Setup

Replace the following settings in the app config file for Twitter.
**Important** to tweet using the Twitter API you must have [elevated access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api) which you should apply for.

```bash
 "TwitterConfig": {
    "Consumerkey": "<TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY>",
    "ConsumerSecret": "<TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET>",
    "AccessToken": "<ACCESS_TOKEN>",
    "AccessTokenSecret": "ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET>"
  },
```

Telegram requires you to set up a bot + a channel.

```bash
 "TelegramConfig": {
    "AccessToken": "<TELEGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN>",
    "ChannelName": "<TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_NAME>"
```

### Build + Run

Publish as a self-contained net5.0 app, with single file option checked.
I had issues with running this on Linux OS, so I have this currently deployed on AWS, smallest available EC2 instance.

The following command will run the bot for ETH, params are:

```bash
    lyrabot.exe <ASSET> <TWITTER_ENABLED> <TELEGRAM_ENABLED>
```

Example:

```bash
    lyrabot.exe eth true false
```

Use the lyrabot.bat file in the scripts folder to spin up 4 versions of the bot, 1 for each asset.
